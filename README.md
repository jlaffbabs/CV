# Background

I am a full-stack developer, having recently graduated from Makers' Academy
- a 16 week coding bootcamp. I am at my best when I am able to use my logical
mind and passion for problem solving and Makers' allowed me to realise that
coding is the perfect outlet for this skillset. I have now left the course
eager to take this learning experience further and prepared to add to my
knowledge.

# Skills

### Problem Solving/Logic

I have always thrived in areas where I have to use logical steps to arrive at a specific solution. My success in mathematical subjects throughout School and University, whether it be getting Gold in the Senior Maths Challenge or earning the top score in my Economics class at UCL in a statistics exam, are testaments to this. This skill has reflected itself in my programming, allowing me to have a very methodical approach to debugging and tackling problems I may have not faced before.

### Clean Code

Having clean code is something I find very rewarding and during my time at Makers Academy I learnt more efficient ways of doing this as well as the benefits. I find TDD to be a good tool to maintain clean code, as well as programming principles such as DRY. Often I would volunteer my services for a large refactor during a team project at Makers' as I find I am not completely satisfied by a functioning product until the code looks nice and is easy for other developers to read.

### Fast Learner

Picking up alien concepts and methodologies has always been a strong suit for me. Whether it come from being walked through once by someone who already has knowledge of the task at hand or through my own research, I find I will be able to grasp it quickly. This was reflected many times throughout my coding bootcamp, whether it was in tackling a new ORM, issues with our first deployment, or just getting to grips with a new language with a completely different scope.

### Teamwork/Communication

I tend to enjoy working as a team and bouncing off other people, whether it be to learn from them, help them or just enjoy eachother's company! Things such as running after school clubs at primary schools as a volunteer while I was a student, or playing a large organisational role in my football club at university demonstrates my ability to work together with others and my willingness to work for others. I have found using an Agile process in team exercises very rewarding, and I enjoy having a very open conversation, both to satisfy my aim for a clean, functioning, product as well as allowing me to garner the pleasure I do from social interaction.
