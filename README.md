## Jacques Laffy

I am currently a student at the Makers' Academy coding bootcamp. Prior to this, I graduated from Bsc Economics at UCL and my logical mind and passion for problem-solving let me to begin experimenting with programming. Upon completion of my course, I aim to keep progressing and hopefully enter my first job as a software developer, ideally in an environment where I will be challenged and pushed to improve.


## Skills

#### Problem Solving/Logic

Since a young age, I have always thrived in subjects where I have to use logical steps to arrive at a specific solution. Experimenting with coding has really emphasised to me the extent to which this is applicable, and gives the same pleasures as upon completion of a tricky maths problem. My success in mathematical subjects throughout School and University, whether it be getting Gold in the Senior Maths Challenge or earning the top score in my Economics class at UCL in a statistics exam, are testaments to the fact that my mind works far better in analytical and logical scenarios.

#### Teamwork/Communication

I tend to enjoy working as a team and bouncing off other people, whether it be to learn from them, help them or just enjoy eachother's company! Things such as running after school clubs at primary schools as a volunteer while I was a student, or playing a large organisational role in my football club at university demonstrates my ability to work together with others and my willingness to work for others.
